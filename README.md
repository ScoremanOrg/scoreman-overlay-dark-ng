# scoreman-overlay-react

This is a set a of components to easily create a [**scoreman**](https://github.com/scoremanOrg/scoreman) overlay, with a sample basic overlay, ready to use with scoreman.

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
so everything you know about CRA can be use here.

## Available Scripts

To do any kind of development with a running instance of **scoreman** server, ensure
you run, perharps on a different shell
```npx -p @scoreman/server scoreman --port 8080 --cors```

This project assumes scoreman is running on the localhost, on port 8080, with CORS enabled.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
